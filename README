UTCS-Webturnin-Utilz
Seth Hoenig 2012 (seth.a.hoenig@gmail.com)

A collection of utilities to make grading projects less dreadful.
There are two categories: stuff for running batches of files against
MOSS, and stuff for grading projects.

moss/
    init - Sets up files and folders in /tmp for use with
        the other two scripts. It is expected that the zip files
        containing all students code are located in /tmp when this is
        run. (ex: CS303E-527xx.zip)
    mover - Moves all .py files from different sections into the
        /tmp/mdump directory, first prepending the student's utcs
        username to the file.
    mossnet - Submission script that takes all the files in /tmp/mdump
        and submits them to MOSS for review.


grading/
    filemaker - Creates a grades.txt file which can be used for keeping
        track of scores and comments.
    comments - Creates and/or uploads comments from a given grades.txt
        file.
    gutilz.py - Contains some utility functions shared among scripts.
    resort - Takes a grades.txt file and resorts the records by either
        utcs account name or eid. This is to work around the fact that
        blackboard sorts only by uteid and webturnin sorts only by
        utcs account name.
